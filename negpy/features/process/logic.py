    back in itself (`camera_to_working_matrix`), and the Calibration panel already documents
    Linear RAW as inert there — but the decode was reading the stored flag regardless, so a
    hidden, stale toggle silently decided whether white balance was applied.

    Every site that decides `use_camera_wb` must ask this one question. The decode and the
    matrix have to agree: apply white balance at both, or at neither. Splitting them tints
    the render by the raw green-to-red ratio, which is roughly 2:1.

    It matters most to a bracket. `use_camera_wb` applies each *file's* own multipliers, and
    a camera left on auto white balance records different ones per frame — on a real
    8-frame slide bracket the darkest frame's B/G came out 1.41 against ~1.8-2.1 for the
    rest. Frames then sit on different scales, and the exposure ratios solved between them
    absorb the difference: that bracket's shortest link solved to 0.75 EV instead of 1.00,
    which prints as contour rings around a blown highlight.

    estimate, and narrowband light has no color temperature that estimate can describe — the
    same reason white balance cannot fix the hue rotation narrowband light imposes (see
    docs/USER_GUIDE.md's Hue Trim). Folding it back in for a narrowband capture is not a
    milder version of the correct fix, it is the wrong correction: there is no scene white
    balance for the fold to reconstruct, whatever the camera happened to read.

    wrong film — an approximate correction for dyes that are not there, which is worse
    than none. Narrowband's real payoffs (defeating the orange mask, clean separation
    ahead of a high-gain inversion) belong to negatives, and a slide has neither.

    Single source of truth for the rule: the sidebar greys the toggle on it and
    `effective_input_icc` suppresses the profile on it, so the two cannot drift. An
    explicit Input ICC is a deliberate choice about the user's own source and still wins

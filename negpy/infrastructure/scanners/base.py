    Obligations beyond the signatures:

      scanner with no selectable source must still populate it or it never appears.
    - `scan` raises `TransientScanError` for retryable transport failures and a plain
      exception for everything else — that choice is the backend's alone.
    - `scan` reports progress as `progress(fraction)`, or `progress(fraction, phase)`
      when it has more than one phase to distinguish. The fraction is relative to
      the phase, not the scan, so a backend reporting several rewinds to 0.0 at each
      one and the label is what makes that legible. A caller supplying `progress`
      must therefore accept the phase as optional, defaulting it to "Scanning".
    - `eject` returns False for a device with no eject action; it raises only when a
      present eject genuinely fails.
    - The constructor raises `ScannerUnavailable` when the driver is missing, with an
      install hint in the message.

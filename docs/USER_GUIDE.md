# NegPy User Guide

NegPy turns film scans into finished positives with a non-destructive, darkroom-style pipeline. Nothing is ever written back to your source files. Every edit lives in a local database, so you can experiment freely.

This guide is for new users. It explains what each control does, when you'd reach for it, and roughly what it does to your image. If you just want to know *why* the pipeline is ordered the way it is, read [PIPELINE.md](PIPELINE.md).

---

## 1. The Big Picture

### Screen layout

*   **Left, the film strip**: your loaded frames as a contact sheet, plus import, sorting, and triage tools.
*   **Centre, the canvas**: the live preview of the current frame. Most tools (crop, white-balance picker, heal brush, dodge/burn masks) are used by clicking directly on it. With nothing loaded it shows **Load some scans to get started** — click it for **Add files** / **Add folder**.
*   **Right, the controls**: a pinned **Analysis** readout at the top, and below it an icon tab bar. Each icon opens a *workflow page* holding one or more collapsible panels.

### The workflow (and the order things happen)

The right-hand tabs are arranged in the order you actually work, which mirrors the processing pipeline:

| Tab | Icon | Panels | What it's for |
|-----|------|--------|---------------|
| **Setup** | cogs | Presets · Calibration · Process · Roll Analysis | Film type, capture-side colour corrections, negative→positive normalization, roll-wide baselines |
| **Geometry** | crop | Geometry · Flat Field | Crop, straighten, lens/falloff correction |
| **Exposure** | sun | Filtration · Tone · Dodge & Burn | White balance, print density/contrast/curve/saturation, local burns |
| **Colour** | palette | Lab · Toning | Chroma, sharpening, effects, split/chemical toning |
| **Finish** | brush | Retouch · Finishing | Dust removal, vignette, border, carrier |
| **Favourites** | star | Your chosen sliders | Quick access to the controls you use most |
| **History** | clock | Work prints · Edit history | Keep named versions, step back through every change |
| **Export** | file | Export settings | Format, size, colour, batch output |
| **Metadata** | tags | Archival metadata | Original camera/lens/film details |
| **Scan** | camera | Scanner · Camera Scanning | Capture film directly (Linux/macOS) |

You don't have to touch every panel. NegPy's defaults are tuned to produce a good print straight away, and most frames need only a crop, maybe a white-balance nudge, and export.

A small **dot** on a panel header (and on a tab icon) means you've changed something from its default. Every panel header has a **reset** action to return that panel to defaults, and an **ⓘ** that opens this guide at that panel's section.

Both side panels can be narrowed to give the canvas more room. As the controls panel shrinks, tab icons that no longer fit move into a **»** menu at the right of the tab bar; the tab you are on always stays visible.

---

## 2. Film strip (left panel)

The header shows the NegPy logo and version (and an update link when a new release is out); the chevron at its top-right folds the branding away to give the frames more room, and NegPy remembers that too. Below it: the toolbar, the search box, and then two collapsible sections — **Library** (the folders your scans live in) and **Film Strip** (the frames you have open). Click either heading to fold it away; the one still open takes the whole panel, and a folded one keeps just its heading. NegPy remembers which were open.

### Your library

The **Library** section is a folder tree of the places your scans live. Press **+** to add a folder — point it at the one big `Scans` directory you keep everything under, subfolders and all. **↻** re-reads it from disk. Each row shows what is inside it ("36 photos", "2 folders"), and subfolders are read when you expand them.

**Browsing costs nothing.** Nothing is opened, decoded or hashed when you add a folder or click through the tree — NegPy just lists what is there.

#### The Library button

The **Library** button (book icon, first in the toolbar, or **Ctrl+L**) opens the folder your scans live in. The first time you press it, NegPy asks you to pick that folder and remembers it. It is also where the panel goes on its own: on launch when you don't restore a session, and whenever you unload the last frame — your rolls are a more useful resting state than an empty sheet.

To point it somewhere else, add another folder with **+**; to forget them all, use **Clear Library** in *Manage Database* (that clears the list of folders only — your images, folders and edits are untouched).

#### Walking around

*   **Click** a folder to select it, **double-click** (or **Enter**) to open it.
*   **Ctrl+click** several folders and open them together to load more than one roll at once — you are asked once, for the total.
*   **Alt+Up** moves the selection to the folder above.
*   The tree sorts the way the sheet does: change **Sort** to Date or Descending and the folders follow.

When you open a folder that actually contains images, NegPy asks whether to **load the roll** — and only then does it hash and thumbnail them, which is the part that takes a moment on a big roll. Say no and nothing happens; your open frames stay exactly as they were. Tick **Always load without asking** in that prompt if you would rather it just get on with it.

Loading a roll replaces what's in the film strip (right-click → **Add to session** appends instead). Nothing is lost either way: your edits live in NegPy's database, not in the list of open files.

#### Folders are your folders

NegPy reads the tree straight from disk and never creates, renames, moves or deletes anything in it — reorganize in Finder or Explorer and the tree simply shows the new arrangement next time you refresh. Because every edit is stored against the image's content, moving a file between folders keeps its edit, its history and its keep/reject mark.

### Importing & managing files

Toolbar buttons, left to right:

*   **Add files** / **Add folder**: load individual images or every image in a folder. Pick a folder that only holds *other* folders and NegPy reveals it in the Library section instead of reporting that it found nothing. Dropping a folder on the window does the same.
*   **Clear all**: unload everything (or, when several frames are selected, unload just those).
*   **Hot Folder**: watches the current folder and auto-loads new files as they appear, handy when a scanner drops files into a directory.
*   **RGB Scan**: treats the folder as red/green/blue exposure triplets and assembles each frame from three shots (for narrowband trichrome scanning). Right-click a frame → **Edit RGB Triplet…** to assign the three files by hand.
*   **Half Frame**: splits each scan into two frames (for half-frame cameras), edited and metered separately. When enabled, a rectangle editor opens on the current scan: drag the green box to crop (everything outside is discarded), drag the orange line to set the split, and use the **Cut thickness** slider to discard a band centered on the split (the physical black separator between the two exposures). The setting is saved and applied to every half-frame split from then on, regardless of how the scans were acquired (SANE scanner, camera copy-stand, or folder import). The **Adjust Half Frame** toolbutton (next to Half Frame) re-opens the editor on the current scan to fine-tune. Auto-detection of the gutter still seeds the initial split position.
*   **Apply (clone)**: copy the current frame's settings to selected frames or the whole roll. You choose which aspects in a dialog (crop and rotation are always per-image).
*   **Sheet filter** (funnel): show *All frames*, *Keepers only*, or *Hide rejected*.
*   **Sort**: by Name or Date, ascending or descending.

Above both sections: a **filter box**, a **`.*`** regex toggle and a **search-library** button. Inside the Film Strip section, a **tally**, e.g. "36 frames · 12 keepers · 3 rejected".

#### Filtering the sheet

Type a plain word and it matches the filename, as before. Beyond that the box takes `field:value` terms, which is how you find a frame by what it *is* rather than what it was called:

| Term | Finds |
|---|---|
| `film:portra` | frames whose film stock contains "portra" |
| `camera:"Nikon F3"` | quote anything with a space |
| `iso:>=400` | numeric fields also take `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` (`iso`, `frame`, `push`) |
| `date:2024-03` · `date:>=2024` | by file date; a partial date is a prefix |
| `roll:` `developer:` `lens:` `format:` `scanning:` | the rest of the Metadata panel |
| `name:` `path:` `ext:tif` | file identity |
| `keeper:` `rejected:` `edited:` | frames carrying that mark, or with a saved edit |
| `-rejected:` `-film:velvia` | a leading `-` negates any term |

Terms combine with AND, so `film:portra iso:>=400 -rejected:` is all three conditions at once. Metadata comes from each frame's own **Metadata** panel, so it is searchable once you've filled it in — a frame you have never edited is findable by name, extension, date and mark. The **`.*`** toggle switches the box back to a plain regex over filenames, which ignores the field syntax.

#### Searching the whole library

The filter box narrows what is already open. The **magnifier-over-folder** button beside it (or **Enter** in the box) runs the same search across every library folder instead, and loads what it finds — so `film:portra` finds your Portra frames in folders you haven't opened this month. The status bar counts files as it goes.

This works without opening anything because NegPy already knows which edit belongs to which file. A frame you have never edited is still findable by name, extension or date; film stock, camera and the rest come from frames you have filled in. The folders are only read, never indexed in the background and never modified.

Right-clicking **empty space** in the film strip offers **Add files**, **Add folder** and **Clear all**, so those tools stay in reach part-way down a long roll instead of only at the top of the panel. Here **Clear all** always means the whole session, never just the selection.

#### Stitching a frame from several shots

If one negative was captured in overlapping pieces (a copy stand at higher magnification than the frame), select the pieces and right-click → **Stitch selected frames**. NegPy finds the overlap, matches brightness across the seam and replaces the parts with a single wide composite named *a+b (Stitch)*. The parts' own edits stay on file, so right-click → **Unstitch** puts them back untouched. The registration is saved with the session and replayed on the next launch, so re-opening a composite costs nothing.

This works on RGB-scan frames too: turn on **RGB Scan** first so each piece is already assembled from its own R/G/B triplet, then stitch the assembled frames. Each part keeps its own three exposures — nothing is shared between parts.

Narrow the panel and the toolbar buttons that no longer fit move into a **»** menu at its right edge, so the panel can be squeezed down to give the image more room without losing any tool.

### Triage (culling the roll)

Right-click a thumbnail (or use keyboard shortcuts) to mark frames while you review the sheet:

*   **Keep**: a small check badge marks a keeper.
*   **Reject**: a cross badge dims the frame. Rejected frames stay on the sheet but are skipped by batch exports and sidecar writes. **The file on disk is never touched.**

Marks apply to a multi-selection and persist across sessions. A badge in the top-right corner instead flags a frame that failed to decode.

The right-click menu also offers **Copy/Paste Settings** (with or without normalization bounds), **Reset Settings**, **Apply settings…**, and per-frame export.

<!-- panel:analysis -->
## 3. Analysis readout (always visible)

Pinned above the tabs, this is your feedback while printing. Drag the divider to resize it, or collapse it entirely. Everything in it describes the frame you're on and updates as you edit; the zone strip is the one part you can also act through. Top to bottom:

#### Photometric curve

The chart is the paper characteristic (H&D) curve NegPy is printing through right now. It models how a sheet of photographic paper responds, and it is not a curves editor. Left to right is **negative density**, the exposure the paper receives: dense parts of the negative (the scene's highlights) sit to the right. Bottom to top is the **print tone** that comes out. A steeper curve means more contrast, which is what Grade moves. The flattening at each end is the toe (shadows) and shoulder (highlights), where the paper runs out of range.

The crosshair marks the **pivot**: the density the curve rotates around when you change contrast, so the midtone stays put. While you drag a slider a faint **ghost** of the previous curve stays behind for comparison. If cast removal pulls the channels apart you get three separate R/G/B traces instead of one grey curve, and that spread *is* the colour correction.

#### The two histograms

Two different histograms share the chart. Behind the curve, rising from the bottom, is the **output histogram**: the tones of the print you're looking at, in R, G, B and luminance. Along the bottom axis is the **negative density histogram**, which is what the scan actually contains, before the curve.

Read them against each other: the density histogram tells you which part of the horizontal axis your negative occupies, and the curve tells you what happens to it. If the negative's data sits entirely on the flat toe, no amount of contrast will pull those shadows apart. Move the exposure so the data lands on the steep middle instead.

#### LIN / LOG toggle

Bottom-right of the chart. It switches the histogram's *height* axis (how many pixels), not the tone axis. **LIN** is literal, so a big flat sky dwarfs everything else. **LOG** compresses the tall peaks so the thin tails become visible, which is where the few hundred pixels of deep shadow or specular highlight live. Use LOG when hunting for clipping, LIN when judging where the bulk of the frame sits. The choice is remembered between sessions.

#### Clipping triangles

Small R, G and B triangles in the top corners of the chart: **top-left** = shadows crushed to pure black, **top-right** = highlights blown to pure white. They only appear once a channel passes 0.5% of the frame. A little is normal, since a real print has a black. Watch for a single channel clipping alone, which is a colour cast pushing one dye off the end rather than an exposure problem.

#### Zone shading and zone ticks

The amber wash on the left and the blue wash on the right mark the curve's toe and shoulder, the compressed ends where tonal separation is being lost. The ticks along the bottom are Adams zones I to IX, so you can read straight off the axis which zone a given negative density prints as.

#### Step wedge

A 21-step Stouffer-style grey wedge printed through your current curve, in even density increments labelled in the scan's own density units. It's a ruler for the curve: where neighbouring patches are clearly different, you have tonal separation; where they merge into one flat black or white block, those tones are gone. The brackets mark the usable span. It hides while peeking the flat scan, since there's no print curve to wedge.

#### Zone strip

Ten cells on the Adams scale, where **0 is paper black and V is 18% mid-grey**, and the last cell (IX) also absorbs paper white. The brightness of each cell is the zone's tone; how solid it looks is how much of the frame lands there. This is the fastest read of whether a frame is low-key, high-key or sitting sensibly in the middle. The end cells tint **red** when shadows are blocked up or highlights are blown. Hover a cell for its exact percentage.

It is also where you place a tone: **click a cell, then click that spot on the photo** and the print is solved so the spot lands on that zone — see Zone placement below. The armed cell is outlined until you spend it; clicking it again, or Esc, cancels.

#### Probe

A spot densitometer. Hover the image to read the pixel: per-channel density above film base (ΔD, relative to this scan's normalization, not absolute), the displayed tone's reflection print density, and its print zone (0 = paper black, V = 18% mid-grey, X = paper white). In B&W mode the ΔD channels read the pre-conversion colour record.

#### Zone placement

The probe made actionable — what a darkroom enlarging analyser does. **Click a zone on the strip above, then click that spot on the photo**: the print is solved so the spot prints on the zone you asked for, and you see it straight away. Ask for a second and a third zone the same way; a fourth spot replaces whichever pin is nearer. Each pin appears here as a row: what zone it reads now, and the **target** it was given, which the − / + buttons trim in thirds of a zone.

With one pin, Print Density is solved so that tone prints on its target; with two (typically a shadow and a highlight) Print Density *and* ISO-R Grade are solved so both land. A third pin adds one more control for the tone between them — **Shadows Grade**, **Highlights Grade** or **Snap**, whichever of them can actually move that tone, which depends on where it prints rather than on which zone you call it. A line under the button says which, so nothing moves silently; if the third tone already prints where you asked, no third control is touched. What you see until you accept is a preview — **Place zones**, or **Enter** over the photo, commits it as one undoable edit, turns off Auto Density (and Auto Grade from two pins on) since a meter left on would re-move the placed tones, and closes the tool. One pin is enough to accept; you don't have to place a second. **Esc** discards instead: the armed zone first, then the pins and the preview with them, leaving the print as it was. The **✕** on a row removes just that pin — remove the last one and you are back to the committed print.

Pins are handles — drag one to move it, and the zone beside it re-reads as it travels (the cursor turns into a hand over a pin you can grab). A pin keeps the zone it was asked for while it travels, and its caption reads `1 · IV⅓ → VI` — where it is now, and where you are asking it to print; the arrow disappears once the two agree. Clicking the photo without picking a zone first simply pins a reading, leaving the print alone.

Asking for a zone the paper cannot reach shows an amber `→ lands …` with the closest zone the print can make — the solve pegs at the slider's end, like an analyser pegging at grade 5. With three pins the amber also appears when the three asks cannot all be met at once: placing the middle tone nudges the outer two, so the solve alternates between them and reports where they actually settle. Pins are proofs, not edits: Esc cancels an armed zone, then clears the pins, then puts the tool down; they also go on any other edit and when you change frames. The measured zone reads through the print curve — the same model the chart and step wedge use — so after placing, the pin reads its target by construction; later stages (Lab, toning) can still shade the final pixel the hover probe reads.

#### Negative stats

The four numeric rows at the bottom. Each one has the same explanation on hover, and each is a measurement of the negative rather than of your edit:

*   **Negative**: the negative itself, as a relative density range (luminance) plus its development character against a nominal frame: flat (≈N−1), normal, contrasty (≈N+1). It is a relative scale, comparable across a roll, and a heuristic from this scan's normalized bounds rather than a calibrated densitometer reading.
*   **Exposure**: where the frame's midtone sits, in stops from neutral, positive = brighter (high-key), negative = darker (low-key). Approximate, read off the metered midtone rather than a precise meter.
*   **Clipping**: share of pixels crushed to black (shadows) or blown to white (highlights), worst channel. Turns red above 1%.
*   **Scan clip**: share of source-scan pixels at/above sensor white, per channel. In a negative scan the film base and scene shadows sit near sensor white, so clipping there destroys base/shadow separation and no edit can undo it. Fix at capture: expose the scan lower. Turns red above 1%.

## 4. Setup tab

<!-- panel:presets -->
### 4.1 Presets

Save and recall a complete edit (the full workspace) by name.

*   **Preset dropdown** + **Load**: apply a saved preset to the current image.
*   **Name field** + **Save**: store the current settings as a new preset.
*   **Trash**: delete the selected preset.

<!-- panel:sensor -->
### 4.2 Calibration: what your rig does to the colours

Everything here corrects the *capture*, not the look: three different things sit between the scene and your file — the camera's colour filters, the film's dyes, and the light source — and each gets its own control. They are not interchangeable, and none substitutes for another.

**Trichrome Calibration**, for **single-shot narrowband** (RGB-LED trichrome) camera scans. The camera's colour filters overlap the light's bands, so a pure red exposure leaks a little into green and blue. That leak is a fixed property of your sensor and light together and has nothing to do with the film, so it is corrected on the linear capture before inversion.

*   **Profile**: the sensor matrix to apply. Custom `.toml` matrices live in `<Documents>/NegPy/sensor/`.
*   **Calibrate** (vials icon): build a profile from three bare-light R/G/B exposures.

This block greys out unless **Linear RAW** is on, since profiles are calibrated against neutral white balance and the as-shot gains would misapply the matrix. Your selection is remembered either way. It is also skipped for RGB-triplet assets, which never had the leak. Because it changes what the analysis reads, **re-run Batch Analysis** after changing it.

**Crosstalk** (hidden in B&W), a channel unmix applied to the raw negative densities before inversion. The film's dyes each absorb outside their own band, but they are not the only cause: your light's spectrum and your sensor's colour filters mix the channels too, and in the density domain all three arrive as the same kind of error. So treat the matrix as *your whole scanning setup*, not just the film — a profile that works beautifully on one rig may be wrong on another with the same stock.

*   **Matrix**: the profile to apply, grouped in the dropdown by where its numbers came from (measured, tuned on a rig, or from spec sheets). *Generic C41* is the built-in; drop custom `.toml` matrices in `<Documents>/NegPy/crosstalk/` (see [CROSSTALK.md](CROSSTALK.md)). The slider button opens a matrix editor, where a **Type** control records that provenance for your own profiles.
*   **Strength** (0.0 to 1.0): how much of the unmix to apply, for richer and cleaner colour separation. Because it changes what the analysis reads, **re-run Batch Analysis** after changing it.

> **The bundled film matrices are derived from published spec sheets, not measured** — which is why they are all marked *(approx)*. They describe the film's **dyes alone**, so they are only the whole story where your capture reads each dye cleanly: a **true RGB scan** (a Coolscan-style mono sensor lit one band at a time) or a **calibrated trichrome rig** (see *Trichrome Calibration* above). With a broadband light and a Bayer sensor, the capture adds mixing of its own that a dyes-only matrix does not describe — it may still help, but treat the number as a starting point rather than a correction for your setup.

**Worth experimenting with.** - if a stock or a light gives you trouble, open the matrix editor, nudge the six off-diagonal terms and save the result as your own profile. Name it after the *combination* — "Gold 200 + Spectracolor", not just the film. A profile you tuned on your own rig beats any datasheet, and profiles that work are genuinely worth [contributing back](CROSSTALK.md#contributing-a-matrix), since nobody can guess your light and sensor for you.

**Light source:**

*   **Hue Trim** (-30° to 30°, default 0): rotates every hue by a fixed angle to undo the rotation an unusual scanning light imposes. Narrowband LED and odd-phosphor panels sample the dyes away from where the film expects, which turns *every* colour by roughly the same angle — yellows reading orange, greens going olive — while leaving neutrals alone. That is why white balance cannot fix it: the error is a rotation, not a cast, so there is no grey to correct. Judge it on a subject you know the colour of (foliage, a clear blue sky, skin) and leave it at 0 for an ordinary broadband light. The setting is **sticky**: a light source is a property of your rig, so it carries to the next file until you change it. Neutrals are untouched, so it never disturbs the colour-balance clip in **Process**.

<!-- panel:process -->
### 4.3 Process: negative → positive

The foundation of every edit: film type, how the scan is decoded, and how the negative is normalized into a positive.

*   **Scanning setup** (bulb button): a two-question wizard, *how do you scan?* then *what light source?*, that sets Linear RAW and Narrowband for you. It runs once after the first-launch tour; the button reopens it whenever your rig changes.
*   **Linear RAW**: (default off) decodes with neutral multipliers for completely raw data. When toggled off decodes RAW with the camera's as-shot white balance. Toggling reloads the file. Let the **Scanning setup** wizard pick it, or try both and pick which yields better results for your setup.
*   **Narrowband**: corrects the oversaturation typical of narrowband (RGB-LED trichrome) scans using a bundled input profile. Leave off for ordinary broadband scans. An explicit Input ICC in Export overrides it.
*   **Lock Bounds**: freezes the analyzed normalization bounds for this frame, so cropping or moving sliders no longer re-analyzes it. Lock in once you're happy with the bounds.
*   **Mode**: `C41` (colour negative), `B&W`, or `E-6` (slide/reversal). Changes the core conversion math and re-runs the pipeline from scratch. The wand button beside it **auto-detects** the mode when a file loads.
What the wizard sets, by rig:

| Capture | Light source | Linear RAW | Narrowband |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Digital camera | White light (lightbox, CRI LED panel) | off | off |
| Digital camera | Narrowband RGB (Scanlight, RGB LED) | on | on |
| Film scanner | White light (Plustek, Epson, most flatbeds) | on | off |
| Film scanner | Narrowband RGB (Nikon Coolscan, Kodak Pakon) | on | on |

Applying it sets the defaults for newly loaded files, updates the open frame, and rewrites every already-edited frame in the session (undoable per frame with Ctrl+Z).

**Analysis window**, where NegPy measures the black/white points:

*   **Analysis Buffer** (0.0 to 0.25): insets the measurement window from the frame edge so film rebate, sprocket holes, and scanner borders don't skew detection. Raise on scans with wide borders.
*   **Analysis Region** (square-draw tool): draw a freehand region on the canvas to meter *exactly* that area (overrides the buffer). Double-click inside to confirm; the ✕ button clears it.

**Normalization tuning:**

*   **Luma Range Clip** (-100 to 100): how aggressively the tonal range (black/white-point span) is set. Neutral already applies a small robust clip. Positive tightens it, which is good for dense or fogged negatives where a few stray pixels would push the bounds to extremes. Negative pushes the bounds *outward* for lifted blacks / unclipped highlights.
*   **Colour Clip** (-100 to 100): the per-channel colour-balance clip (orange-mask removal), independent of the tonal range. Positive tightens channel balance; negative samples nearer the extremes.
*   **Global / R / G / B** selector → **White Point** / **Black Point** (-0.25 to 0.25): manual offsets on top of the auto-detected bounds. Positive white point brightens; positive black point lifts blacks. In R/G/B mode these become per-layer trims: per-dye-layer film-base (Dmin) and Dmax corrections, i.e. scanner-style per-channel levels. Hidden in B&W.

**Crosstalk**, **Hue Trim** and the sensor unmix all live in **Calibration** (§4.2) — they correct the capture rather than the negative-to-positive conversion.

**Normalize** (E-6 only): auto-stretches a slide's histogram to fill the dynamic range. Useful for faded/expired slides.

<!-- panel:roll -->
### 4.4 Roll Analysis: a consistent look across the roll

Meter the whole roll once and share the baseline, so frames from the same film match.

*   **Batch Analysis**: scans every loaded file and computes a roll-average density and colour balance (outliers discarded). Run it once after importing. *(Tip: if you use Batch Autocrop, run it first, in **Image only** mode, so metering sees consistent crops.)*
*   **Use Luma Average**: this frame takes the roll-wide tonal range; colour still re-derives per frame.
*   **Use Colour Average**: this frame takes the roll-wide colour balance; tonal range still re-derives per frame. Enable both for a fully consistent roll; leave both off for per-image auto-exposure.

**ROLL**, to reuse a baseline across sessions:

*   **Roll dropdown** + **Load**: apply a saved roll's bounds and balance.
*   **Save**: store the current Batch Analysis as a named roll (useful when you shoot the same stock repeatedly).
*   **Delete**: remove the selected roll.

## 5. Geometry tab

<!-- panel:geometry -->
### 5.1 Geometry: crop & straighten

Where the frame gets its final shape: what's inside the print, and whether it sits level. Most scans need a pass here even when nothing else is touched.

**Crop:**

*   **Ratio**: target aspect ratio: `Free`, `1:1`, `3:2`, `4:3`, `5:4`, `6:7`, `7:5`, `65:24`, `16:9`, `16:10`, `11:8.5`. One entry per shape, since the crop tool auto-orients to portrait or landscape as you drag, so there's no separate portrait entry.
*   **Detect** (crosshairs): snap the ratio to the closest standard.
*   **Crop** tool: draw a crop rectangle on the canvas. **Reset** clears it and turns auto-crop off.
*   **Guide**: overlay a composition guide while cropping: *Thirds*, *Phi Grid*, *Diagonals*, *Golden Triangles*, *Golden Spiral*, *Armature*, *Diagonal Method*, *Grid* or *Off*. The redo button rotates guides that have orientations (the spiral has 8, the triangles 2).

**Auto Crop**, to detect the frame edge automatically:

*   **Mode**: *Image only* (exposed area) or *Film edge* (full film incl. rebate/sprockets).
*   **Crop Offset** (-5 to 100 px): inset the detected edge inward. Positive trims more; negative bleeds slightly outside (when detection clips too tightly).
*   **Rebate Trim** (0 to 150%): how far into the detected rebate to cut. 0% stops at the film edge, 100% lands on the detected image edge, above 100% bites into the picture to clear a stubborn white border. *Image only* mode; applies to both **Auto** and **Batch Autocrop**.
*   **Auto**: detect and crop this frame. Best on clean rebate.
*   **Batch Autocrop**: analyze all visible landscape frames as a roll, using confident detections to calibrate weaker ones. Runs in the background with progress and cancellation. Manual, Film-edge, portrait, and ambiguous frames are left alone. Only available in *Image only* mode.

**Alignment:**

*   **Fine Rotation** (±45°): free rotation for tilted scans, in sub-degree steps (positive = clockwise). Applied after auto-crop so the frame stays axis-aligned.
*   **Straighten** tool (ruler): draw a line along a horizon or vertical edge and NegPy rotates to make it level or plumb.

<!-- panel:flatfield -->
### 5.2 Flat Field: even out the light

Corrects uneven illumination (vignetting/falloff) from your copy-stand or scanner light, using a reference shot of the bare light source.

*   **Flatfield Correction**: apply the active reference to this image (enabled once a profile exists).
*   **Reference Profile** dropdown + **Add…** / **Delete**: pick a reference image and save it as a named profile. **Add…** reads the reference once and bakes its correction into the profile, so the original reference file can then be moved, renamed or deleted without affecting your edits — the profile is self-contained (stored in NegPy's own `flatfield` folder, like sensor and crosstalk profiles).
*   **Distortion** (-0.25 to 0.25): radial lens-distortion correction for the rig, saved with the profile. Use the film rebate as a straight-edge reference.

---

## 6. Exposure tab

This is the heart of the print. Three panels shape light, colour, and contrast, and everything here happens in the "print" stage of the pipeline.

<!-- panel:colour -->
### 6.1 Filtration: white balance

Colour timing, like the dichroic filters on an enlarger head. A **Global / Shadows / Highlights** selector scopes the controls to the whole image or biases them toward low- or high-density tones.

*   **Pick WB** (eyedropper): click a pixel that should be neutral grey; NegPy solves the CMY filtration to make it neutral in the selected region.
*   **Roll Lock**: re-aims each newly opened frame's temperature to the current target (its own tint preserved), a per-region lock for consistent warmth across a roll.
*   **Reset** (undo-arrow icon): return the selected region's temperature and CMY to neutral.
*   **Temperature**: a warm↔cool lever driving the region's magenta/yellow pair (cyan stays put, as in a real darkroom).
*   **Cyan / Magenta / Yellow** (-1 to 1): the three filtration axes, Cyan↔Red, Magenta↔Green and Yellow↔Blue.
*   **Cast Removal** (0.0 to 1.0): neutralizes the residual colour cast a negative leaves in the print, balancing each layer so greys stay neutral from deep shadows through highlights (C-41). Applied strength scales with how many clean near-neutrals the frame has. Default ~0.5; 0 turns it off.
*   **Ring-around** (target icon, or `Shift+F`): prints the frame as a 5×5 mosaic stepping 2cc at a time out to ±4cc on the magenta and yellow axes, so the direction of a colour cast is visible instead of guessed. Each patch is a real render of the part of the frame it covers; click one to keep its filtration. The ladder is absolute and centred on neutral, so a ring printed off one frame compares to the next. `Escape` or a second press clears it, and any edit drops it. See **Rotating a proof** below.

<!-- panel:tone -->
### 6.2 Tone: density, contrast, and the print curve

The paper's response. A **Global / R / G / B** selector at the top scopes most controls to the shared curve (Global) or to per-dye-layer trims for **crossover correction**, meaning casts that differ between shadows and highlights, which filtration alone can't fix.

**Automatic helpers** (on by default; they do per-frame work so you don't have to, and turning them off lets the negative print honestly):

*   **Auto Density**: meters each frame's midtone and anchors print brightness there, so dense and flat negatives land consistently.
*   **Auto Grade**: aims each frame at a contrast target instead of printing the negative's own range, so dense negatives stop printing over-contrasty and flat ones stop printing muddy.
*   **Set Targets** (sliders icon): tune the exact brightness/contrast the two helpers aim for. Applies to every frame and is remembered between sessions.

**Test strip** (grid icon, or `Shift+T`): prints the frame as a 5×5 grid, Print Density rising left to right and ISO-R Grade softening top to bottom, so the diagonals read light-to-dark and soft-to-hard like a split-filter test strip. Both ladders are absolute and centred on their defaults, so the settings you already have are one of the patches. Each patch is a real render of the part of the frame it covers; click one to keep it. `Escape` or a second press clears it, and any edit drops it.

**Rotating a proof**: a patch only shows the slice of the frame at its own grid slot, so the part you want to judge is stuck at whichever rung sits over it. While either proof is up, the 90° **rotate** buttons and `[` / `]` turn the *ladder* instead of the image: each press moves the dense/hard end onto a different edge, and the axis labels follow. The image's own rotation is untouched, and turning is instant, because printing a proof assembles all four orientations at once. The orientation you land on is kept for the rest of the session.

**Exposure:**

*   **Print Density** (0.0 to 2.0): overall brightness, simulating enlarger exposure time. Lower = brighter, higher = denser.
*   **ISO-R Grade** (50 to 180): contrast, as a paper ISO-R value. R110 ≈ classic grade 2; **lower R = harder** (more contrast), higher = softer. In R/G/B mode a **Grade** trim rotates one layer's slope about the midtone.
*   **Shadows Density** (±0.9 ΔD) / **Highlights Density** (±0.5 ΔD): brighten or darken just the shadow or highlight zone, without reshaping the curve. Bounded by paper black/white so a burn can't exceed the print's limits. The ranges differ because density is logarithmic: the same ΔD reads far smaller near paper black than near paper white.
*   **Shadows Grade** / **Highlights Grade** (split grade, ±50 ISO-R): rotate contrast locally in the deep shadows or highlights, the digital equivalent of split-grade printing.
*   **Dye Separation** (0.5 to 1.5, hidden in B&W): saturation in density space. It pushes the print's three dye densities apart *before* the positive is decoded, in the same matrix the paper's own dye crosstalk uses. So it responds to the paper profile you picked, and it eases off automatically where the curve is already compressed at toe and shoulder, instead of forcing colour into tones that have none left to give. Below 1.0 pulls the dyes together instead, toward neutral. 1.0 = off. (Contrast **Chroma** in the Colour tab, which scales colour evenly after decode.)
*   **Separation Damping** (0 to 1, hidden in B&W): decides *where* the Dye Separation push lands, rather than adding a push of its own. At 0 every colour gets the same treatment. Turn it up and muted colour keeps the full push while colour that is already saturated gets the opposite, so a hard push puts colour into the tones that had none instead of driving the strongest colours until they flatten into a slab. Below 1.0 separation it mirrors: pastels go grey while the vivid colours survive. **Dead at Dye Separation 1.0**, where the slider greys out, because it has no look of its own. This is not the same as backing Dye Separation off: a lower value takes colour from *everything*, including the tones that had little to start with, where turning damping up takes it only from the colours that already have plenty.

**Paper Response**, the characteristic-curve shape:

*   **Paper profile**: a bundled darkroom-paper profile (RA4 colour papers in C-41, tonal B&W papers in B&W). Re-shapes the curve as a baseline; Grade/Density/toe/shoulder still trim on top. *Neutral* reproduces the defaults.
*   **Paper White**: simulate paper base density, so whites print at ~0.93 instead of pure white, like a real print.
*   **Paper Black**: show the paper's true (slightly milky) Dmax instead of compensating it to pure display black. Off (default) applies black-point compensation so the adapted eye reads black as black.
*   **Snap** (-0.5 to 0.5): midtone gamma, steepening or flattening the S-curve around the reference tone while paper white/black stay put.
*   **Toe** (-1 to 1) + **Toe Width** (0.1 to 5): the shadow roll-off into paper black. Positive toe lifts shadows for a gentle film toe; negative deepens (and, with Paper Black off, makes exact black reachable). Width sets how far the knee reaches into the midtones.
*   **Shoulder** (-1 to 1) + **Shoulder Width** (0.1 to 5): the highlight roll-off into paper white. Positive compresses highlights (film-like); negative extends them and risks clipping.

In R/G/B mode the sliders become per-layer trims on top of the global value, for that dye emulsion: **Grade** (±30 ISO-R), **Toe** / **Shoulder** (±1), **Toe Width** / **Shoulder Width** (±2), **Snap** (±0.5) and **Dye Separation** (±0.4).

<!-- panel:local -->
### 6.3 Dodge & Burn: local exposure

Paint polygon masks and lighten or darken just those areas.

*   **Draw Mask**: click to place vertices; double-click / Enter / a click near the start closes the mask; Esc cancels. To edit an existing mask, select it in the list, then drag a vertex, click an edge "+" to add a point, or right-click a vertex to delete.
*   **Mask list**: each mask shows Dodge (lighten) or Burn (darken) and its strength. The eye toggles its outline; the trash deletes it.
*   **Strength** (-1 to 1 EV): dodge (+) or burn (−) for the selected mask.
*   **Feather** (0.0 to 0.15): edge softness for the selected mask, as a fraction of the frame's short side.

---

## 7. Colour tab

<!-- panel:lab -->
### 7.1 Lab: polish and detail

Mimics what a lab scanner (Frontier/Noritsu) does automatically. Colour controls hide in B&W mode.

**Colour** (hidden in B&W):

*   **Chroma** (0.0 to 2.0): a colour scale applied after the print is decoded, even across every tone, so it is a retouching move rather than a density-space one. 1.0 = unchanged, 0 = greyscale, 2.0 = double. For saturation that behaves like a print instead, reach for **Dye Separation** in the Exposure tab. Below 1.0 is a flat scale; above 1.0, pixels that would clip the display gamut get a soft per-pixel knee toward their own in-gamut headroom instead of a hard per-channel clamp, since clamping only the overshooting channel(s) shifts the hue the flat scale itself preserves.
*   **Skin Protection** (0.0 to 1.0, default 0.5): holds skin-hued colour under a chroma ceiling so faces don't go sunburnt. Hue and lightness are untouched and chroma is only ever pulled down, never added, so asking Chroma for 0 still gives you greyscale. It is independent of Chroma and works with it at 1.0 — skin that arrived over-saturated from the print curve or the filtration gets reined in just the same. Higher values lower the ceiling: the 0.5 default only catches genuinely excessive chroma, 1.0 leaves skin matte, 0 is off. The mask is warm hue *and* skin's own chroma *and* mid lightness together, which is what keeps a red coat, a saturated sunset, brick or autumn colour out of it. What it cannot separate is warm objects sitting at the same chroma as skin — bare wood, tan leather, sand — which soften along with it. The same bound cuts the other way: skin that arrives really excessive (a sunburn) is only partly caught, so reach for Chroma or the Filtration panel for that.
*   **Chroma Denoise** (0.0 to 5.0): smooths colour noise, especially in shadows, while leaving luminance grain intact.

**Sharpen:**

*   **Method**: *Unsharp Mask* (boosts edge contrast) or *Deconvolution* (Richardson–Lucy, which reverses the scanner's optical blur; set Radius to the scan's blur width).
*   **Sharpening** (0.0 to 1.0): amount, on the L (lightness) channel so there are no colour halos.
*   **Radius** (0.5 to 3.0 px): blur width, small for fine grain and larger for soft scans. Scaled to render size so preview matches export.
*   **Masking** (0.0 to 1.0): restrict sharpening to edges, which protects flat areas like sky, skin and grain.

**Detail:**

*   **CLAHE** (0.0 to 1.0): local contrast without blowing global highlights or crushing shadows. Use sparingly, since near 1.0 can look cartoonish. (Runs before dust removal so healing operates on the final rendition.)

**Effects:**

*   **Glow** (0.0 to 1.0): lens bloom, where bright highlights scatter across all channels for a dreamy softness.
*   **Halation** (0.0 to 1.0): the red glow of light scattering back through the film base. Highlights only, strongly red-dominant.

<!-- panel:toning -->
### 7.2 Toning

Colour the print itself rather than the scene: chemical toners that convert the silver (B&W only), and a split tint that works in any mode.

**Chemical Toning** (B&W only), simulated as sequential toner baths, in the order shown, each strength 0.0 to 2.0:

*   **Selenium**: deeper blacks, cool eggplant shadows.
*   **Sepia**: warm highlights first (partial strength gives split-sepia).
*   **Gold**: cool blue-black on untoned silver; over sepia, shifts highlights orange-red.
*   **Iron Blue**: Prussian-blue shadows deepening to navy blacks.
*   **Copper**: pink to brick-red shift, with the classic Dmax loss.
*   **Vanadium**: greens the mids/highlights while deep shadows keep their black.

**Split Toning** (all modes), an additive tint in Lab space, so grain and detail are preserved:

*   **Shadow Hue** (0 to 360°) + **Shadow Strength** (0.0 to 1.0).
*   **Highlight Hue** (0 to 360°) + **Highlight Strength** (0.0 to 1.0).

## 8. Finish tab

<!-- panel:retouch -->
### 8.1 Retouch: dust, hairs, scratches

Spotting, the way it was done with a brush on the finished print. There are three ways to find the marks, by local contrast, by the scanner's IR channel, or by hand, and they stack.

An **Overlay** button cycles the detection overlay (Off → Marked → IR) so you can see what's being caught.

**Optical Removal** finds specks on the visible scan by local contrast, with no IR needed:

*   Toggle **Optical Removal** on, then set **Threshold** (0.01 to 1.0; lower catches more, at the risk of false positives) and **Size** (3 to 8 px; max spot radius).

**IR Removal** uses the scanner's infrared channel to remove dust invisible to the colour dyes (only enabled when the scan carries an IR plane):

*   Toggle **IR Removal** and set **IR Threshold** (0.05 to 0.95; lower catches more).
*   **Method** picks how the film under a defect is rebuilt. Both use the same IR plane and the same threshold slider.
    *   **NegPy** (default) divides semi-transparent dust back out, fills opaque cores with a weighted average of the clean film around them, and transplants grain from the nearest clean pixel.
    *   **OpenICE** works in log density and restores detail rather than averaging it away: at each scale it adds back the picture detail that beats the infrared's own contrast at that scale, so texture under a speck survives. Where a defect was solid there is no detail left to restore, so the repair gets Digital ICE's own synthetic grain instead, strongest in the midtones and fading out at both ends of the scale. It measures clear-film level and dye-to-infrared crosstalk from each frame, and leaves film it judges clean untouched bit-for-bit. Better on fine detail and gentler elsewhere in the frame, but less proven across scanners, so try both on a frame you know.
*   The IR plane is read from 4-channel TIFFs and DNGs (VueScan, NegPy's own scanner output), SilverFast's iSRD TIFFs and 64-bit **HDRi RAW DNGs**, and `_IR.tif` sidecars. Scan to HDRi (not plain HDR) if you want IR data in the file; B&W and Kodachrome block infrared like dust does, so those frames are skipped automatically.

**Manual Heal** (header shows the current spot count):

*   **Heal Tool**: click dust spots in the preview to paint them out one at a time.
*   **Scratch Tool**: click points along a scratch or hair, double-click/Enter to finish; Esc cancels, Backspace removes the last point. Right-click an overlay to delete it.
*   **Brush Size** (2 to 16 px): radius of the manual brush (shown while a manual tool is active).
*   **Undo Last** / **Clear All**: remove the most recent or all manual heals (auto-detected dust is unaffected).

<!-- panel:finish -->
### 8.2 Finishing: vignette, carrier, border

How the print is presented: edge burn, a filed-out carrier's black rebate, and the paper margin around it. Applied at the very end of the pipeline, after everything else is settled.

**Vignette** (printer's edge burn, in stops):

*   **Burn** (-2.0 to 2.0 stops): positive darkens the edges, negative holds them back (lightens). 0 = off.
*   **Size** (0.0 to 1.0): falloff radius. Small keeps it tight in the corners, large spreads it into the frame.
*   **Roundness** (0.0 to 1.0): 0 = radial (lens-like), 1 = rectangular card burn following the print edges.

**Filed Carrier**, a filed-out negative carrier: the clear rebate prints max black, framed by a margin of unexposed paper:

*   **Width** (0.0 to 5.0 mm): black rebate frame thickness. 0 = off.
*   **Roughness** (0.0 to 1.0): how raggedly the aperture was filed, on the paper-side edge of the black frame. The picture-side edge is the camera's film gate and only ever wobbles slightly.
*   **Flare** (0.0 to 1.0): light reflected off the bared metal of the filed bevel, a glow that lifts the black just inside the filed edge and stains the paper just outside it. Coloured on colour film (the hue drifts along the edge, as the stray light never passes the orange mask), neutral in B&W. 0 = off.
*   **Corners** (0.0 to 1.0): how far the aperture's corners round off, since no file cuts a sharp inside corner.

The paper margin takes the mat colour, so it runs into the border with no seam.

**Border:**

*   **Width** (0.0 to 2.5): border thickness as a fraction of the image. 0 = no border.
*   **Bottom weight** (1.0 to 2.0): thickens the bottom border (window-mat proportions).
*   **Colour swatch**: click to pick any border colour.
*   **Paper white**: tint the border with the toned paper-white instead of the picked colour.

---

## 9. Favourites tab

The sliders you reach for most, gathered in one place so a routine edit no longer costs a tab
switch and a scroll. Empty until you fill it.

*   **Edit Favourites**: opens a picker. Tick sliders on the left, order them on the right with
    the arrow buttons, then **Apply**.
*   The panel then shows those sliders in your chosen order. They are the *same* controls as in
    their home panels — moving one here moves it there, and vice versa. Nothing is duplicated or
    moved out of its own tab.
*   A favourite hides itself when its original does. Favourite a Filtration slider and it will
    disappear while you are in black & white, where it has nothing to act on.
*   Your selection is remembered between sessions.

---

## 10. History tab

Two lists: the versions you chose to keep, above the running record of every change.

### Work prints

A **work print** is a named version of this frame — the darkroom habit of keeping the prints you made on the way to the final one, so you can go back to the third attempt after deciding the fifth went too far.

*   **Save work print** (**Ctrl+Shift+S**) keeps the current edit under a name; NegPy offers *Work print 1*, *Work print 2* and so on. Saving over an existing name asks first.
*   **Click** one to make it live. That counts as an edit, so **Ctrl+Z** puts back what was on screen before — you cannot lose your place by looking at an old version.
*   **Right-click** → **Export this version…**, **Rename…** or **Delete**.

Work prints differ from history steps in the way that matters: they are **never pruned and never thrown away by a later edit**. The undo history keeps the last 100 steps and drops the branch above you when you edit after stepping back; a work print survives both. The list only appears once you've saved one.

They belong to the frame, not to your presets — a preset is a look you apply to other images, a work print is one version of this print. Both live in NegPy's database; work prints are not written to `.negpy` sidecars.

### Edit history

A scrollable list of every edit step (last 100 kept), newest on top; the current step is bold.

*   **Click** a step to jump to that state.
*   **Right-click** → **Export this version…** to export a past state directly.

---

## 11. Export tab

### Output intent

*   **Print** (default): the full creative look you see on screen.
*   **Flat**: a flat, neutral, low-contrast master that keeps maximum tonal/colour information for editing elsewhere (Lightroom, Darktable, Photoshop). Skips the print look, effects, toning, and vignette, and writes a wide-gamut 16-bit TIFF. Your in-app preview is unaffected.
    *   **Preview Flat**: temporarily show the flat master on the canvas without changing your edit.
    *   **Roll Baseline**: measure every visible frame and share one exposure baseline, so flat masters are consistent across a roll (recommended before a flat batch).
*   **Linear**: bypass the entire darkroom pipeline and dump the scanner's or camera's decoded buffer as an untagged linear 16-bit TIFF. No normalization, exposure, colour management, flatfield, or sensor correction — just the raw data with lossless geometry (rotation/flip) applied. Supported sources:
    *   **Pakon RAW** — 4× expansion by default (14-bit sensor range scaled into 16-bit). F335 files (16-bit sensor) default to no expansion.
    *   **LinearRaw DNG** — SilverFast HDRi (3-channel) and VueScan (4-channel RGB+IR). IR is written as a separate grayscale TIFF with an `_ir` suffix.
    *   **Camera RAW** — demosaiced with unity white balance (1,1,1,1). The camera's as-shot WB is written into XMP (`RAW-WB: R G B`) so it can be applied by downstream tools. Source device and timestamp are preserved. RGB-scan triplets (narrowband R/G/B exposures) are merged into a single combined TIFF. Stitch composites are assembled with flatfield and sensor correction applied per-part for clean seams; stitch + triplet combinations are also supported.
    *   **Coolscan NEF** — Nikon Coolscan scanner files. Despite the name, these are not raw sensor data — the content depends on the Nikon Scan settings used at scan time. Getting linear, unprocessed output requires the right settings before scanning. The full-res RGB SubIFD is read directly; any extra channels beyond RGB are dropped (Coolscan has no separate IR channel). No expansion.
    *   **Flextight FFF** — Imacon/Hasselblad Flextight scanner files, including both standard uncompressed 16-bit RGB exports and SGI LogLuv compressed raw files (`.3fr`/`.fff`). LogLuv files are decoded through a LogLuv → XYZ → linear sRGB pipeline with per-channel percentile normalization (LogLuv is HDR, so normalization is part of the decode — without it the data would be truncated, not raw). The largest image IFD is selected by pixel count. Data is linear scanner transmittance. Embedded FlexColor metadata (film stock, film type, scan date, scanner serial) from the proprietary plist (tag 50457) and firmware blob (tag 46279) is carried through to the output TIFF headers. No expansion.
    *   **Noritsu RAW** — headerless BGR 16-bit scanner dumps. Frame dimensions are auto-detected from file size against known Noritsu scan dimensions. 16× expansion by default (12-bit sensor data in 16-bit range).
    *   **TIFF** — generic scanner TIFFs. If the file has a 4th channel tagged as IR (ExtraSamples = UNSPECIFIED or missing), it is written as a separate `_ir` TIFF. Sidecar IR files (`_ir.tif` next to the source) and IR stored in secondary TIFF pages are also detected. **Input gamma** lets you select the gamma encoding of the source (linear, 1.8, 2.2, or sRGB) so the data can be linearized before export. Expansion is available (off by default).
    *   **Expansion**: scales the linear data before writing. The combo box shows source-appropriate options: Pakon F135/F235 default to 4×, Noritsu defaults to 16×, F335 and LinearRaw DNG default to off. Camera RAW, Coolscan NEF, and Flextight FFF files have no expansion option. Leave at the default unless you know why you need to change it.
    *   **Apply ICE dust removal** (visible when an IR channel is available): applies IR-based dust and scratch correction to the linear output before writing. Off by default.
    *   **Corrections** (camera RAW only): three optional toggles that bake corrections into the linear output before writing. All default to off (raw dump philosophy). **Apply white balance** multiplies by the as-shot WB gains. **Apply flatfield** applies the flatfield gain correction. **Apply sensor correction** applies the sensor crosstalk unmixing matrix. For stitch composites, flatfield and sensor correction are always applied per-part regardless of these toggles (required for clean seams).

    The output TIFF is always written clean — no ICC profiles, no EXIF color space tags, and no XMP color metadata from the source are carried through. Only raw pixels plus device metadata (Make, Model, DateTime) from the source file.

### Export button

The primary **Export** action. Its chevron menu picks the scope: current frame (Ctrl+E), selected frames, all visible with current settings, or all visible with each frame's saved settings.

### Format / Size / Colour / Destination

*   **Format**: `JPEG`, `TIFF`, `PNG`, `JPEG XL`, or `WebP` (with quality/effort options per format).
*   **Colour Space**: `Same as Source`, `sRGB`, `Adobe RGB`, `ProPhoto RGB`, `P3 D65`, `Rec 2020`, or `Greyscale` (true B&W output).
*   **Input / Output ICC**: soft-proof against, and optionally embed, an ICC profile. Output is the destination profile (default); Input treats the profile as the source (when a scan's profile is known but untagged). Input overrides **primaries only** — the tone curve is always the pipeline's own, so a matrix-style profile's declared TRC is ignored (two profiles with identical primaries but different TRCs render identically); a LUT-style profile's own input curves are still honoured.
*   **Paper Aspect Ratio**: final print ratio, or *Original* (no resize).
*   **Resolution**: *Original* (full RAW resolution), *Print* (long-edge **Size** in cm + **DPI**), or *Pixels* (long-edge **px**; short side follows the paper ratio).
*   **Destination**: **Filename Pattern** (a Jinja2 template with export settings plus Metadata fields such as roll, camera, film — see [TEMPLATING.md](TEMPLATING.md)), **Overwrite** toggle, and output location (subfolder of source / same as source / an absolute **Export Path** with a browse button).

### Collapsible sections

*   **Presets**: a checklist of export presets (each a saved Format/Size/Colour/**Destination**/filename recipe). **Manage** edits them; **Export Presets** renders the frame(s) with every enabled preset at once — each preset uses **its own** destination, not the sidebar Destination above.
*   **Sidecars**: **Save on export** writes a `.negpy` edit sidecar next to each source on every export; **Export sidecars** writes them for all visible frames now. (Edits always stay in the database too; sidecars are optional archival copies.)
*   **Contact Sheet**: render all visible frames into a single sheet. Choose a **Template** or set **Cell / Gap / Margin / Max tiles** by hand, pick an output **Path**, and **Export contact sheet**.
*   **Preview** (affects the on-screen preview only, never the file):
    *   **Soft proof** (on by default): simulate the export colour space and Output profile so what you see matches what you'll get. Turn off only to preview at full gamut.
    *   **Display**: the monitor profile the preview is shown through, auto-detected, or pick one manually if detection fails.

---

## 12. Metadata tab

Archival metadata for the **original analog capture** (camera, lens, film, process), written into exported files as EXIF and embedded XMP so DAMs like Lightroom show your film gear rather than the scanner.

*   **Protect original metadata**: copy the source file's EXIF/XMP to exports unchanged, adding nothing. When on, the fields below are ignored.

**Analog Gear** (searchable; type in any field to filter the library):

*   **Preset**: a reusable camera + lens + film combination. **Clear** empties gear selections.
*   **Camera / Lens / Film stock**: pick from your library. Empty = not set.
*   **Manage…**: edit cameras, lenses, film stocks, and presets. Starter data seeds into `~/NegPy/gear/` on first launch.

**Process:**

*   **Format**: `35mm`, `120`, `4×5`, `8×10`, `110`, or `Other` (with a free-text field).
*   **Developer**: e.g. `D-76 1+1`.
*   **Push / Pull**: `Push +3` … `Normal` … `Pull -3`.

**Scanning:**

*   **Scanning**: scan method/notes (EXIF `Software` is always `NegPy`).
*   **Roll / Frame**: Scanlight capture roll name and frame number. Stamped automatically on capture; editable here. Available in export filename templates as `{{ roll }}` / `{{ frame }}`, and written to XMP as `negpy:CaptureRoll` / `negpy:CaptureFrame` when set (not the Roll Analysis normalization name).
*   **Sync custom metadata to all files in batch export**: apply this tab's values to every file in a batch.

**Exposure**: optional original shutter/aperture/ISO. Click the lock to edit a free-text string (e.g. `1/125s f/2.8 ISO 400`).

**Metadata preview**: a live view of exactly what will be embedded, grouped by capture / scan / process / file. **Description…** opens a checklist of which fields join into EXIF `ImageDescription`. Defaults are camera, lens, film stock, and ISO — format, developer, push/pull, and scanning are off until you enable them. Confirming **Description…** sets that frame's selection and becomes the sticky default for other frames that don't have their own; the last confirm on the roll wins. Sync metadata / Sync settings can also copy a frame's selection with the rest of the metadata.

When you set capture gear, it's written to standard EXIF and the digitizing rig is preserved separately in `negpy:Scan*` XMP tags. Leave gear unset and your scanner/DSLR stays visible in EXIF instead.

---

## 13. Scan tab

Capture film directly into NegPy (Linux and macOS; unavailable on Windows). Two collapsible sections:

*   **Scanner (SANE)**: drive a supported flatbed/film scanner over SANE. Common controls: backend/device selection, DPI, bit depth, IR channel, autofocus, hardware auto-exposure, frame range (roll feeders), scan window, output format, folder and filename template. When the connected scanner exposes a SANE `scan-exposure-time` option (e.g. some genesys devices), an **Exposure** slider appears below Auto-exposure — set it to override the scanner's default exposure time; the value shows in µs, ms or s as appropriate. A device without the option hides the slider, so a saved value never breaks a different scanner.
*   **Camera Scanning**: DSLR/mirrorless copy-stand capture. Auto-connects the camera over USB (PC-Remote mode). With a NegPy **Scanlight** connected it captures narrowband R/G/B triplets from saved film-stock presets; without one it does a single white-light exposure. A **Live View** window helps you frame and focus; captured frames land in the hot folder and flow straight into RGB-Scan mode.

Camera scanning needs the optional `python-gphoto2` dependency (`pip install gphoto2`; no Windows build). See [CAMERA_SCANNING.md](CAMERA_SCANNING.md).

## 14. Startup Override (`override.toml`)

If NegPy crashes on launch or has rendering glitches, you can force backend settings without touching code. On first run NegPy creates `Documents/NegPy/override.toml` with defaults for your OS. Edit it and restart.

| Setting | Values | Effect |
|---------|--------|--------|
| `rendering.backend` | `"auto"`, `"vulkan"`, `"dx12"`, `"metal"`, `"cpu"` | GPU backend for image processing. `"cpu"` disables GPU entirely. |
| `display.qt_rhi_backend` | `"auto"`, `"vulkan"`, `"d3d12"`, `"metal"`, `"opengl"`, `"software"` | Qt UI rendering backend. |
| `display.qt_platform` | `"auto"`, `"xcb"`, `"wayland"` | Window system plugin (Linux only). |
| `performance.max_texture_size` | `"auto"` or a number, e.g. `4096` | Caps GPU texture size; reduce on low-VRAM cards. |
| `performance.force_hq_preview` | `true` / `false` (or absent) | Overrides the saved HQ preview toggle. |
| `performance.preview_cache_max_bytes` | a number, e.g. `1200000000` | Preview cache memory budget (default ~1.2 GB). |
| `performance.preview_cache_max_entries` | a number, e.g. `8` | Max recently-viewed photos kept in memory. |
| `performance.preview_cache_max_full_res_entries` | a number, e.g. `2` | Full-resolution HQ preview buffers kept in memory (a 60 MP scan is ~700 MB each). |
| `performance.cpu_parallel` | `true` / `false` (or absent) | Multi-core CPU rendering kernels. Defaults on, except macOS. |
| `logging.level` | `"debug"`, `"info"`, `"warning"`, `"error"` | Log verbosity. Use `"debug"` when reporting issues. |

**Common fixes:**

*   **Crashes immediately on Linux** → `backend = "cpu"` or `qt_rhi_backend = "opengl"`.
*   **Black/blank preview on Windows** → `backend = "dx12"` or `qt_rhi_backend = "software"`.
*   **Wayland rendering issues** → `qt_platform = "xcb"` to force X11.
*   **GPU out-of-memory during export** → `max_texture_size = 4096`.

## Additional Info

*   **GPU acceleration**: NegPy uses your GPU for near-instant previews and responsive sliders. The Process panel's analysis (bounds, white/black point, normalize) runs on the CPU. There is no global GPU switch in the UI, so force the CPU pipeline via `override.toml` if you suspect a driver issue.
*   **Database**: all edits live in a local SQLite database keyed by file hash, so you can move or rename files without losing your work. Optional `.negpy` sidecars mirror edits next to your sources.
*   **Saving edits**: edits are written to the database on export, when you switch frames, or when you save explicitly. Closing the app mid-edit without any of those loses unsaved changes.
*   **Keyboard shortcuts**: [KEYBOARD.md](KEYBOARD.md)
*   **Filename templating**: [TEMPLATING.md](TEMPLATING.md)
*   **The pipeline in depth**: [PIPELINE.md](PIPELINE.md)
